          With over five years of experience in software development, including two years dedicated to building enterprise-grade applications, I bring a strong foundation in both academic and professional environments. This portfolio is powered by a modern full-stack architecture using React, Node.js, and Next.js, hosted on Vercel.
          <br /><br />
          My technical strengths include designing scalable microservices, developing secure and functional applications, and managing end-to-end software delivery. I've led development efforts on high-impact government systems, implemented role-based access control with Microsoft Entra ID, and built dynamic, user-focused platforms using the Microsoft Power Platform, Azure, and SharePoint.
          <br /><br />
          I approach challenges as opportunities to innovate and refine my skillsâ€”whether it's prototyping with Figma, writing Python-based data analysis pipelines, or building UI-rich applications in TypeScript and React. I invite you to explore the highlights section for various projects showcasing my expertise in Python, React, web-scraping, and ML.
