  ## This Portfolio ‚Äì Developer Profile Website

  A statically optimized, fully responsive developer portfolio built with modern full-stack technologies including **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. The project is hosted on **Vercel** using a serverless architecture and continuous deployment via **GitHub Actions**.

  The site showcases key professional highlights and personal projects, integrating animation, responsive design, and clean UX/UI practices. Design prototypes were developed in **Figma**, with a strong emphasis on accessible content structure and performance optimization.

  ### üîß Key Features
  - Modular project architecture with dynamic routing  
  - Tailored UI/UX components built from scratch and styled via Tailwind  
  - Rich project highlights section with live previews and categorized tech stacks  
  - Custom background animation for visual impact  
  - Integrated resume download, social links, and direct contact options  

  This portfolio not only demonstrates core front-end and design skills, but also reflects strong experience in system integration, **DevOps** (via GitHub Actions), and component-driven development.`,

  ## Overview

  This portfolio was built with a strong emphasis on **clarity**, **modularity**, and **developer experience**. It functions both as a professional showcase and as a lightweight playground for experimenting with modern web practices.

  Key features include:

  - ‚ö° **Static Site Generation (SSG)** via Next.js for optimal performance and SEO
  - üé® A **component-first architecture** for reusability and maintainability
  - üì± **Mobile-first responsive design** using Tailwind's utility classes
  - üîÅ Continuous deployment integrated with GitHub for seamless updates

  ---

  ## Technical Architecture

  The site is powered by the **Next.js App Router**, leveraging its support for file-based routing and metadata handling. All pages are statically generated at build time, ensuring instant load speeds with CDN-level caching through Vercel.

  **Tailwind CSS** provides a performant, design-system-like layer for styling. All UI components are modular and built from the ground up, avoiding external UI libraries to keep the design minimal and intentional.

  CI/CD is handled entirely by **Vercel**, triggered via GitHub pushes to the "main" or "working" branch. Vercel handles the build, cache invalidation, and atomic deployments automatically for production and testing environments.

  ---

  ## Deployment Model

  - The site is **deployed serverlessly**, with no backend infrastructure.
  - Static assets and pre-rendered HTML are distributed globally via Vercel‚Äôs edge network.
  - This results in <50ms TTFB globally and zero-maintenance scaling.

  ---

  ## Developer Experience

  - üß™ Local development uses "vercel dev" for parity with production
  - üß© Modular "data/.ts" files allow dynamic page generation without a CMS
  - üõ†Ô∏è Strict TypeScript and ESLint configs ensure clean, safe code

  ---

  ## Future Improvements

  - Add structured content authoring via MDX
  - Add a dedicated pre-release environment for user testing
  - Integrate a lightweight CMS (e.g., Contentlayer or Sanity) for easier project additions
  - Support dark mode and accessibility refinements

  ## Resume Scanner ‚Äì AI-Powered PDF & Text Matcher

This project combines a lightweight **Flask API** with a sleek React front-end to compare resume content against job descriptions using **sentence-transformer embeddings**. It enables users to upload a resume, input a job posting, and receive detailed similarity scores, helping quantify alignment between qualifications and job requirements.

### üîç How It Works
- Users upload resumes in ".pdf", ".doc", or ".docx" format.
- The resume is parsed into plain text client-side using "pdf.js" or DOCX parsing.
- The job description is split into individual requirement sentences.
- Both texts are sent to a **Flask API**, which uses **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)** to embed and compare them.
- The API returns the best-matching sentence pairs along with similarity percentages.
- Matching results are rendered in a stylized UI with highlights and scores.

This project highlights both **natural language processing skills** and **full-stack integration**‚Äîbridging AI/ML tooling with production-ready user interfaces.`,

## Overview

This RESTful API accepts:

- üî§ Keyword queries
- üìÑ PDF text content

It returns **semantic match percentages** using **sentence-transformer embeddings**.

### Deployment

- üêç Flask back end
- üê≥ Dockerized for deployment
- üß™ Tested with various transformer models

  ## Hybrid ETF Portfolio Tracker & Local AI Commentary Writer

This project merges a **public ETF tracking dashboard** with a **private local AI system** to deliver professional-grade investment analysis and commentary.  
It showcases skills in **full-stack development**, **quantitative finance analytics**, and **local AI orchestration**.

### üìä How It Works
- The **Vercel-hosted Next.js frontend** displays ETF bundle performance, asset allocations, and AI-generated commentary.
- A **Supabase cloud database** stores public-facing ETF data and AI reports, ensuring 24/7 availability.
- A **local lab environment** (MySQL/Postgres) is the *master source* for ETF data and AI-generated insights.
- **Market data APIs** (Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io) feed live or daily data into the local database.
- A **local AI runtime** (Ollama or LM Studio) generates investor-style reports using **Mistral 7B** or **LLaMA 3 8B**.
- A **sync script** pushes fresh data and commentary to Supabase for public display.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** enables secure remote API and DB access without exposing the home network.

This hybrid design demonstrates **real-time financial analytics** combined with **AI-generated insights**, making it relevant for both **quant finance** and **AI/ML applications**.

## Overview

This system consists of two main components:

- üåê **Always-On Public Side**:  
  Hosted on Vercel, powered by Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Supabase.  
  Displays ETF bundle data, allocation charts, and AI-generated commentary.

- üñ• **On-Demand Local AI Side**:  
  Runs locally for heavy compute tasks, such as generating portfolio commentary or cover letters.  
  Uses Ollama or LM Studio to run quantized **Mistral 7B** or **LLaMA 3 8B** models.  

### Deployment

- üì¶ **Frontend**: Vercel-hosted Next.js app with TailwindCSS
- üóÑ **Cloud DB**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for public data storage
- üíª **Local DB**: MySQL/PostgreSQL for master data
- ü§ñ **AI Runtime**: Ollama/LM Studio with local inference
- üîí **Networking**: Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote API access
- üìà **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io APIs
